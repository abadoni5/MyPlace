## Project Highlights

### Chakra UI and Next.js

During the development of MyPlace, I had the opportunity to become familiar with Chakra UI and Next.js. Chakra UI provided a delightful development experience with its intuitive API and ready-to-use components. Its responsive design and accessibility features made it an ideal choice for building a user-friendly web application.

Next.js, on the other hand, introduced me to its new app directory structure, enabling easy organization of components, pages, and other project files. This structure facilitated efficient development and enhanced code maintainability.

### Efficient Website Routing

Building MyPlace also taught me the best practices for routing a website. Leveraging Next.js's built-in routing capabilities, I implemented dynamic routing to handle different property pages and search queries. This allowed for smooth transitions between pages, improving the overall user experience.
